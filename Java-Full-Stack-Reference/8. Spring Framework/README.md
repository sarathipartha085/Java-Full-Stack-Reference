# 8. Spring Framework - 8-12 Days

The **Spring Framework** is a powerful tool for building Java-based enterprise applications. Its rich feature set enables the development of complex, maintainable, and scalable systems. However, due to its complexity, it's essential to have a solid understanding of prior concepts like **Git**, **Java Basics**, **OOP**, and **Collections** before diving in.

> **Note:** Ensure you have a foundational understanding of the concepts listed above to maximize your learning speed and effectiveness.

### Topics to Cover:

1. **Spring Core:**
   - Learn about **Dependency Injection** and how Spring uses it for Inversion of Control (IoC).
   - Understand how the **IoC container** works and how to manage application components.
   
2. **Spring Boot:**
   - Learn to build stand-alone applications with **minimal configuration**.
   - Explore auto-configuration, embedded web servers, and Spring Boot starter dependencies.
   
3. **Spring MVC:**
   - Understand how to create **web applications** using Spring MVC.
   - Learn about the **Controller**, **View**, and **Model** components in the MVC pattern.

4. **Spring Data JPA** *(Already covered in Databases section)*:
   - Learn to interact with databases using **JPA repositories**.
   - Automate CRUD operations and query execution using Spring Data JPA.
   - Since **JPA** and **Hibernate** are already covered in the **Databases** section (Topic 7), you can skip this part for Spring and focus on the Spring-specific integrations.

5. **Spring Security:**
   - Learn how to secure your applications with **authentication** and **authorization** mechanisms.
   - Implement role-based security and user authentication.

6. **Spring REST:**
   - Learn to build **RESTful APIs** with Spring.
   - Understand REST principles, request mapping, and response handling.
