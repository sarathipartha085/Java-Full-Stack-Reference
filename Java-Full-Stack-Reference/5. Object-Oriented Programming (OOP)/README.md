# 5. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - 4 Days

A solid understanding of OOP concepts is essential. Focus on one concept per day to fully grasp each.

## Concepts to Master:
- **Encapsulation / Data Hiding:** Controlling access to data (using private, protected, public)
- **Abstraction:** Hiding complexity by exposing only necessary details
- **Inheritance:** Reusability through parent-child class relationships
- **Polymorphism:**
  - **Runtime (Dynamic/Late Binding):** Method overriding
  - **Compile-time (Static/Early Binding):** Method overloading
- **SOLID Principles:** Design principles for modular, maintainable code
  - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
  - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
  - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
  - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
  - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
