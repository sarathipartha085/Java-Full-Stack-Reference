# Build Tools

## 2. Build Tools

### Backend: Gradle & Maven - 1 Day

Java developers often rely on **build tools** for managing dependencies, building projects, and automating tasks. Two widely-used tools are **Gradle** and **Maven**. This section will guide you to get started with both.

---

### 1. Gradle [For more](Gradlew/)
Gradle is a flexible and powerful build tool for Java projects. It uses a **Groovy** or **Kotlin** DSL for configuration and is known for its performance and flexibility.  

- **Key File**: `build.gradle`
- **Features**:
  - Handles dependencies efficiently.
  - Supports multi-project builds.
  - Highly customizable and integrates with various tools.

---

### 2. Maven [For more](Maven/)
Maven is a project management and build automation tool based on **XML configuration**. It simplifies project builds with its convention-over-configuration approach.  

- **Key File**: `pom.xml`
- **Features**:
  - Dependency management with repositories like Maven Central.
  - Standardized project structure.
  - Plugin support for various build and testing tasks.

### Frontend: NPM (Not Required for Now)
While **NPM (Node Package Manager)** is a critical tool for frontend development, it is **not required** for backend-focused **Java Full Stack Developers** at this stage. Focus on mastering Gradle, Maven, and core Java concepts for now.
