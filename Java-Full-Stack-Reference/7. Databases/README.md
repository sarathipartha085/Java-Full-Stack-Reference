# 7. Databases

## 1. SQL - 2 Days

### Focus Areas:
- **Basic SQL Operations:**
  - `SELECT` – Retrieve data from a database
  - `INSERT` – Insert data into tables
  - `UPDATE` – Modify existing data
  - `DELETE` – Remove data from tables
- **Joins** – Combining data from multiple tables using different types of joins (`INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, etc.)
- **Subqueries** – Writing queries within queries for complex data retrieval
- **Normalization** – Structuring a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity (1NF, 2NF, 3NF)
- **Indexing** – Optimizing database queries for performance by creating indexes on frequently accessed columns
- **Relational Database Design:**
  - Understanding schemas, tables, and relationships between entities
  - Foreign keys and primary keys
