## 1. Version Control (Git) - 1 Day

- **Purpose:** Git is essential for version control and collaboration. Understanding Git is fundamental for all developers.
- **Focus Areas:**
  - Git basics: Clone, commit, push, pull, branch
  - Understanding `git flow` and best practices for team collaboration

---

## 2. Build Tools

### Backend: Gradle & Maven - 1 Day

- **Gradle** (build.gradle): A flexible build tool for Java projects.
- **Maven** (pom.xml): A project management and build automation tool.

Learn both tools, as they are widely used in Java development for managing dependencies, builds, and packaging.

### Frontend: NPM (Not Required for Now)

- **Note:** NPM (Node Package Manager) is not required for backend-focused Java Full Stack developers at this stage. Focus on backend and core Java concepts.

---

## 3. Java Basics - 2 Days

- **Concepts to Learn:**
  - **Syntax:** Variables, operators, loops, conditionals
  - **Control Flow:** `if`, `else`, `switch`, `for`, `while`
  - **Methods:** Calling and returning methods
  - **Error Handling/Control:** `try-catch` blocks, `throws`, custom exceptions

---

## 4. Frontend Development (HTML, CSS, JS) - 5-7 Days

- **Focus Areas:**
  - **HTML:** Structure of web pages (elements, attributes, tags)
  - **CSS:** Styling (selectors, properties, box model)
  - **JavaScript:** Basics of scripting, DOM manipulation, event handling

---

## 5. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - 4 Days

A solid understanding of OOP concepts is essential. Focus on one concept per day to fully grasp each.

### Concepts to Master:
- **Encapsulation / Data Hiding:** Controlling access to data (using private, protected, public)
- **Abstraction:** Hiding complexity by exposing only necessary details
- **Inheritance:** Reusability through parent-child class relationships
- **Polymorphism:**
  - **Runtime (Dynamic/Late Binding):** Method overriding
  - **Compile-time (Static/Early Binding):** Method overloading
- **SOLID Principles:** Design principles for modular, maintainable code
  - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
  - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
  - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
  - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
  - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

---

## 6. Collections - 3-5 Days

- **Concepts to Learn:**
  - **In-built Data Structures:** Arrays, lists, maps, sets, queues, and stacks
  - **Java Collections Framework:** Understand the interfaces and classes like `List`, `Set`, `Map`, `Queue`
  - Explore various implementations (e.g., `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, `HashSet`, `LinkedList`)

---

## 7. Databases

### SQL - 2 Days

- **Focus Areas:**
  - Basic SQL operations: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
  - Joins, subqueries, normalization, indexing
  - Understanding relational database design (schemas, tables, relationships)

### NoSQL (MongoDB or Firestore) - 1 Day

- **Concepts to Learn:**
  - Non-relational databases and document-oriented storage
  - Basic CRUD operations in NoSQL databases

### ORM (Object Relational Mapping) - 2-3 Days

- **Focus Areas:**
  - **JPA (Java Persistence API):** Mapping Java objects to database tables
  - **Hibernate:** A framework for implementing JPA, managing database transactions, and simplifying ORM

---

## 8. Spring Framework - 8-12 Days

- **Note:** The Spring framework is a powerful tool for building Java-based enterprise applications. Its complexity requires a solid understanding of prior concepts (Git, Java Basics, OOP, Collections).
  
**Topics to Cover:**
- **Spring Core:** Dependency injection, IoC container
- **Spring Boot:** Building stand-alone applications with minimal configuration
- **Spring MVC:** Creating web applications (Controller, View, Model)
- **Spring Data JPA:** Working with databases through JPA repositories
- **Spring Security:** Securing your applications (authentication and authorization)
- **Spring REST:** Building RESTful APIs

---

## Learning Path Recommendations

1. Follow the topics in the order listed from 1 to 7.
2. Focus especially on concepts 1, 3, and 5 as they are foundational for understanding and implementing Spring and other frameworks.
3. Practice daily.
